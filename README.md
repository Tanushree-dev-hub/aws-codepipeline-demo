⚙️ CodePipeline with Terraform & DevSecOps using GitHub Actions and Kubernetes Sealed Secrets
This project establishes a robust CI/CD pipeline on AWS using Terraform, enhanced with cutting-edge DevSecOps practices via GitHub Actions. It provisions an end-to-end AWS CodePipeline (Source, Build, Deploy to EC2) and validates infrastructure with Terratest. Further, it integrates GitHub Actions for automated DevSecOps, incorporating security scanning (tfsec for Terraform, Trivy for Docker images) and secure secret management with Kubernetes Sealed Secrets. This ensures a secure, automated, and efficient application delivery workflow, triggered on every code push.# aws-codepipeline-demo

Usage / How it Works
This project is divided into two main tasks: provisioning an AWS CodePipeline with Terraform and enhancing it with DevSecOps practices using GitHub Actions and Kubernetes Sealed Secrets.

Task 1: AWS CodePipeline using Terraform
This task focuses on provisioning a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy with Terraform. It sets up an automated deployment from GitHub to an EC2 instance, with infrastructure validation using Terratest.

📌 Task Objectives
Use Terraform to provision AWS CodePipeline with Source (GitHub), Build (AWS CodeBuild), and Deploy (AWS CodeDeploy to EC2) stages.
Define infrastructure as code for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, IAM roles/policies, and an S3 artifact bucket.
Write infrastructure tests using Terratest to validate Terraform modules.
Apply Terraform and verify a successful deployment.
📦 Prerequisites for Application Deployment
Your application repository must contain:

✅ buildspec.yml: Defines the build and artifact steps for AWS CodeBuild.
✅ appspec.yml: Required by AWS CodeDeploy for EC2 deployments.
✅ scripts/install.sh: Script to install dependencies on the EC2 instance.
✅ scripts/start.sh: Script to start your application (e.g., a React app).
You can copy these example files from the examples/ folder in this repository or refer to a working example application repository.

🧪 Infrastructure Testing with Terratest
To validate the Terraform modules using Terratest:

Install Prerequisites: Ensure you have Go (for Terratest), Terraform, and Git installed.
Project Structure: Organize your project like this:
DevOps-Masters-Project/
├── terraform/                     # Your Terraform code (main.tf, variables.tf, etc)
└── test/                          # Terratest files
    └── terraform_pipeline_test.go
Write the Test Code: Create test/terraform_pipeline_test.go
package test

import (
  "testing"

  "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestTerraformPipeline(t *testing.T) {
  t.Parallel()

  tf := &terraform.Options{
    TerraformDir: "../terraform", // Adjust path as per your directory
  }

  defer terraform.Destroy(t, tf)             // Cleanup resources after test
  terraform.InitAndApply(t, tf)             // Run terraform init + apply

  pipelineName := terraform.Output(t, tf, "codepipeline_name") // Replace with actual output variable name
  assert.NotEmpty(t, pipelineName)
}
Ensure Terraform Output Is Defined: In your terraform/output.tf (or main.tf), include an output for the pipeline name:
output "codepipeline_name" {
  value = aws_codepipeline.my_pipeline.name # Update "my_pipeline" with your actual resource name.
}
Initialize Go Project: From the DevOps-Masters-Project root:
go mod init devops-masters-test
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
Run the Test: From the root directory:
go test ./test
This will initialize and apply your Terraform, capture and assert outputs, and automatically destroy resources.

Task 2: DevSecOps Integration using GitHub Actions and Sealed Secrets
This task integrates advanced DevSecOps practices into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated security scanning and Kubernetes Sealed Secrets for secure secret management.

Setup GitHub Actions Workflow

Create the GitHub Actions workflow file: .github/workflows/devsecops-pipeline.yml

name: DevSecOps CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate-terraform:
    name: Terraform Validation & tfsec
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.5

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Format
        run: terraform fmt -check

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate

      - name: Run tfsec (Terraform security scan)
        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
Add Docker Image Build + Trivy Scan

Extend the same workflow (.github/workflows/devsecops-pipeline.yml) with a job for Docker build and Trivy scanning:

  docker-security:
    name: Docker Build & Trivy Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: validate-terraform
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:latest .

      - name: Install Trivy
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
          wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
          echo deb https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb stable main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install trivy -y

      - name: Scan image with Trivy
        run: trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH myapp:latest
Encrypt Kubernetes Secrets using Sealed Secrets

a. Install kubeseal CLI: bash choco install kubeseal  # Windows brew install kubeseal   # macOS  b. Generate a Kubernetes Secret: bash kubectl create secret generic db-creds --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=pass123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > secret.yaml  c. Encrypt using kubeseal: You need the Sealed Secrets controller certificate from your Kubernetes cluster (e.g., my-sealed-secrets-cert.pem). bash kubeseal --cert my-sealed-secrets-cert.pem -o yaml < secret.yaml > sealed-secret.yaml  d. Store sealed-secret.yaml: Place this file in a folder like k8s/secrets/ in your GitHub repository.

Sample sealed-secret.yaml (for Kubernetes)

apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  name: db-creds
  namespace: default
spec:
  encryptedData:
    password: AgB0c34xX2... # Your encrypted password
    username: AgD1Ukw... # Your encrypted username
  template:
    metadata:
      name: db-creds
      namespace: default
📌 Save this in your repo at: k8s/secrets/sealed-secret.yaml

Sample deployment.yaml for Kubernetes This demonstrates how your application deployment can consume the secrets.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:latest # Replace with your actual image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: DB_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-creds
                  key: username
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-creds
                  key: password
📌 Save this as: k8s/manifests/deployment.yaml

Deploy to Kubernetes in Workflow

Add the final deployment job to your GitHub Actions workflow:

  deploy-kubernetes:
    name: Deploy to Kubernetes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: docker-security
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup kubectl
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
        with:
          version: v1.29.0

      - name: Configure Kubeconfig
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.kube
          echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_BASE64 }}" | base64 -d > ~/.kube/config

      - name: Apply Sealed Secret
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets/sealed-secret.yaml

      - name: Deploy app manifests
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/
NOTE: Store your kubeconfig securely as a GitHub secret (e.g., KUBECONFIG_BASE64), base64 encoded.

🧪 Final Test Flow (When You Push Code)
Upon a code push to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will execute:

Terraform configuration is validated and scanned with tfsec.
A Docker image is built and scanned for vulnerabilities with Trivy.
Sealed secrets are applied to the Kubernetes cluster, securely provisioning sensitive data.
The application is deployed to Kubernetes, utilizing those decrypted secrets.
